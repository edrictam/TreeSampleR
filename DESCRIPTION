Title: Fast Implementations of Exact Random Spanning Tree Samplers 
Version: 1.0
Date: 2024-11-14
Author: Edric Tam
Maintainer: Edric Tam <edrictam@stanford.edu>
Description: TreeSampleR provides C++ based implementations of three random spanning tree samplers, namely the Aldous-Broder sampler, Wilson sampler and the fast-forwarded cover sampler of Tam, Dunson and Duan (2024). A principled way to probe the correctness of random spanning tree samplers is also provided.
